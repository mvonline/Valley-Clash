# Valley Clash

A browser-based fan tribute fighting game: **stylized vector likenesses, original procedural art only**. Masters from the Valley of Peace and beyond. **Not affiliated with DreamWorks.**

## Live demo

Play in the browser (hosted build — same menu as local **`index.html`**):

**[https://vafa.one/Valley-Clash/](https://vafa.one/Valley-Clash/)**

## Quick start

Clone or download the repo and open **`index.html`** in a modern browser, or open any build file directly:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`kfp-valley-clash.html`](kfp-valley-clash.html) | **Canvas 2D** — single file, no extra dependencies. |
| [`kfp-valley-clash-pixi.html`](kfp-valley-clash-pixi.html) | **Pixi.js** — same gameplay; arena is drawn to an offscreen 2D canvas and composited via Pixi (GPU). Loads Pixi from an ESM CDN (needs network). |
| [`kfp-valley-clash-animated.html`](kfp-valley-clash-animated.html) | **Animated** — articulated limb fighters, parallax valley stage, hit / block / chi / landing particle FX. |

If the page is opened as a local file (`file://`), some browsers restrict modules or audio; for Pixi builds, a tiny local server works best.

## Game modes

- **Arcade — 1P vs CPU** — You pick a master; the CPU gets a random rival and the match starts immediately.
- **Local versus — 2P** — Player 1 selects a warrior, then Player 2 selects a different one, then **Fight**.
- **How to play & combos** — In-game reference for controls and combo rules.

**Match rules:** First to **two round wins**. Blocking reduces damage. Each round opens with a **3-2-1** countdown, then **FIGHT!**

**Audio:** Procedural sound effects and looping background music (Web Audio). If you hear nothing, tap / click / press a key once (browser autoplay policies).

## Controls

| | Move | Jump | Block | Punch | Kick |
|---|------|------|-------|-------|------|
| **Player 1** | `A` / `D` | `W` | Hold `S` | `J` | `K` |
| **Player 2** | `←` / `→` | `↑` | Hold `↓` | `V` | `B` |

Player 2 may also use **numpad `4`** (punch) and **`5`** (kick), mapped the same as `V` / `B`.

## Combos

Every fighter has **two unique three-step chains**. On the **ground**, while **idle** (or leaving block into idle), press the sequence in order; the **final** step triggers a **signature special** (big damage and hitbox).

Internally, combos are defined with **punch = J** and **kick = K**. **Player 1** uses **`J` / `K`** on the keyboard. **Player 2** uses **`V` / `B`** (same roles: **V** = punch, **B** = kick). On **character select** in **2P mode**, after Player 1 has locked in, the combo list shows **`V` / `B`** for the player who is choosing.

The table below lists sequences in **Player 1 notation** (`J` / `K`). For Player 2, substitute **J → V** and **K → B**.

### Roster note (art reuse)

Some later-film characters **reuse** another fighter’s procedural silhouette for visuals (`spriteAs`) while keeping **unique** stats and combos. Gameplay and combo tables above are **per character**; only the in-fight drawing may match another master’s shape.

## Tech snapshot

- Single-page **HTML + inline JavaScript**.
- **Canvas** build: one `<canvas>` for the arena.
- **Pixi** build boots WebGL via Pixi and blits the same logical frame.
- **Animated** build (`kfp-valley-clash-animated.html`): same logic as Canvas; procedural skeleton limbs, layered background, simple particle system.

Enjoy the Valley Clash.
